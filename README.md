## Introduction
This project is an exercise I have done for the Data Engineering Course at Udacity. The core idea of the activity is to build an ETL pipeline using the Pyspark framework to extract data from an S3 bucket, create tables based on the star schema, and save those tables at another S3 bucket.

## Datasets
Two datasets were provided, song dataset and log dataset.

### Song dataset
A subset of data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). This dataset contains metadata about songs and the artists of those songs.

### Log dataset
The log dataset consists of log files of users' activities from imaginary music streaming app, generated by an [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the Million Song Dataset.
